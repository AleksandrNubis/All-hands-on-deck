All hands on deck
In a standard deck of cards, there are 13 of each suit. There are numbered cards (from 2 to 10) and face cards (Jack, Queen, King, and Ace). If we were to rank the face cards Jack would be 11, Queen 12, King 13 and the Ace â€” 14. 

Write a program that calculates the average rank of one hand of cards. Don't forget to consider the rank of the face cards.

The input format:

Six values of cards, each on a separate line.
